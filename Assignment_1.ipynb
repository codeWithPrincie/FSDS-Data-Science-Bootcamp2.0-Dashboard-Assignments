    "Ans: Numeric - In Python, numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value. Numeric value can be integer, floating                number or even complex numbers. These values are defined as int, float and complex class in Python.\n",
    "               (1) Integers -  This value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without                                fraction or decimal). In Python there is no limit to how long an integer value can be\n",
    "               (2) Float - This value is represented by float class. It is a real number with floating point representation. It                            is specified by a decimal point. Optionally, the character e or E followed by a positive\n",
    "                           or negative integer may be appended to specify scientific notation.\n",
    "               (3) Complex Numbers – Complex number is represented by complex class. It is specified as (real part) +                                                (imaginary part)j. For example – 2+3j.\n",
    "     Sequence type - In Python, sequence is the ordered collection of similar or different data types. Sequences allows to                          store multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion. There are several sequence types in Python\n",
    "                (1) String - In Python, Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. A string is a collection                                of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote. In python \n",
    "                             there is no character data type, a character is a string of length one. It is represented by str                                class.\n",
    "                (2) list - Lists are just like the arrays, declared in other languages which is a ordered collection of data.                              It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.\n",
    "                (3) Tuple - Just like list, tuple is also an ordered collection of Python objects. The only difference between                             tuple and list is that tuples are immutable i.e. tuples cannot be modified after it is created. \n",
    "                            It is represented by tuple class.\n",
    "     Boolean - Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False. Boolean objects that are equal to True are truthy                (true), and those equal to False are falsy (false). But non-Boolean objects can be evaluated in \n",
